1. the first four values passed in a runfile eg 1 1 1 1 represent columns and rows as presented in main.f as values NHW,NVN,NHE,NVS.
The only use I found so far is that they index matrices or vectors, but not sure what they represent physically, eg  coordinates for landscape or something?

2. This might be related to the previous question, but the site data file takes in grid cells connections which can be 1 = lateral connections or 3 = no connections. 
Is this with respect to the terrain, eg whether its tiled or not?

3. The topography file takes (NW SE column row) for each unit within the landscape, but that is just four values eg 1 1 1 1 in dryland maize. I am a bit confused as to what these are supposed to represent.

4. In the soil data, IXTYP=surface litter type:1=plant,2=manure. IXTYP takes in 2 values at index 1 and 2. In the dryland_maize example it takes in values 3 and 1 respectively.
I am confused here as why there are 2 entries here, is there one for plant and one for manure and if so what does 3 and 1 stand for then? maybe g m^-1 or something like that?


Why is koppen climate zone a numerical value? How do you count it? On wikipedia, I have only counted up to 30 but the maize example takes in 31

What does PFT stand for? Perfluorinated compound potentially?

What is the 2 lines of the output represent? Also why are 100 Yes/No provided, as from the code it seems there are less than that that are actually read

Whats up with years file I tried to understand it in code but couldnt?
